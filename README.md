# Loan Predictions

The goal of this project was to predict whether a loan will be settled. The solution is based on the dataset containing the [LendingClub data](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club) which is available on Kaggle.

The task was simplified to the binary classification. This means that all observations marked as `current` were removed, `fully_paid` labels were coded as 0 and the rest as 1.
